# Travel Agency with <img src="https://github.com/devicons/devicon/blob/master/icons/nodejs/nodejs-original.svg" title="NodeJs"  alt="NodeJs" width="40" height="40"/>&nbsp; 
Coded a travel agency website with NodeJs, Express, Sequelize and MVC. I used PUG and Bootstrap for the views.
The travel examples come from a MySQL database.
It contains a form section where people can leave their testimonials of the trip. Once the information is validated, it is added to the database and displayed in its section.
