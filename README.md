# agenciaViajesNode
Coded a travel agency website with NodeJs, Express, Sequelize and MVC. I used PUG and Bootstrap for the views.
The travel examples come from a MySQL database.
It contains a form section where people can leave their testimonials of the trip. Once the information is validated, it is added to the database and displayed in its section.
